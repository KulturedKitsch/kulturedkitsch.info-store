Just kidding. It is still thriving, though in different ways than ever before. Just last year, Google&amp;#39;s Adsense (its flagship advertising vessel) purportedly lost 33% of its net revenue, not surprisingly coinciding with AdBlocker&amp;#39;s 33% increase in usership. Does this mean that the party is over? How can we reach our clients?

&lt;h2&gt;Good news: it&amp;#39;s only getting cheaper.&lt;/h2&gt;
This decline in the cost of advertising is ultimately a good thing for small businesses. Yet the decline in effectiveness means that we need cleverer mechanisms to reach our audiences. Indeed, most of this site (and my blog, YouTube channel, SM, mailing list, ...) is dedicated to those cleverer alternatives. Does this mean that it is not worth it to pursue traditional advertising?

&lt;h2&gt;Most businesses can do better.&lt;/h2&gt;
Yes, online advertising is undergoing a transformation. The businesses being rewarded are those who are bringing new energy and creativity to the table, not just more marketing dollars. Eventually, just like caller ID did to telemarketing or spam filters did to email marketing, our online ads will have to become more valuable to the consumer.

&lt;h2&gt;Still the best for targeting some demographics.&lt;/h2&gt;
If your can land your logo, offers, and branding in front of a captive audience, then this is still a good investment. For example, if your business is targeting older demographics, then print ads, the space on shopping carts at the store, or radio ads will help your cause significantly. You may be surprised to learn that magazine ads can be very affordable with a good ROI or that some local television spots offer ad-time for only hundreds of dollars monthly.

Affiliation with related businesses is the key to success. In yesterday&amp;#39;s marketing we used terms like &amp;quot;competition&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;to describe our B2B relationships with those sharing our market. Now, due to rapidly changing marketplaces and the consumer attitudes, the fellow businesses in your industry are your greatest allies.

&lt;h1&gt;More than commissions.&lt;/h1&gt;
Owing to a vast market for affiliate marketing, the first idea of affiliation regards commissioned promotions of specific products or services. This is certainly a kind of affiliate marketing, though it barely scratches the surface of the potential with B2B partnerships. In its most refined form, we might label affiliate marketing as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;marketing synergy&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;or as a subcategory of guerilla&amp;nbsp;marketing.

&lt;h1&gt;Making affiliations is purely B2B.&lt;/h1&gt;
It requires not only an awareness of the other players in your field, it necessitates marketing to them. This means that they must already be familiar with your brand, excited by your proposition, and eager to share their market stake. Naturally, the best targets are businesses bigger than your own. In order to accomplish this, you will need a long-term and coordinated strategy between marketing and sales.&amp;nbsp;

It surprises many business owners to hear that cold calls are still a viable strategy for their B2B business model. Yes, the response rate from B2B coldcalling is 20x to 100x stronger than the business-to-consumer method. With many of my clients, we discover that the cost of initiating a telemarketing campaign is only a tenth of the price of their typical contract. In other words, the payback period is short and sweet.

&lt;h1&gt;Who&amp;#39;s behind the phone matters.&lt;/h1&gt;
Here at Kultured Kitsch we contract our telemarketers individually, training them for the first 300 hours. By working closely with our tele-salesmen and women, we achieve higher conversions than most companies can boast. More importantly, we work with those in the fray to optimize our scripting of the calls to improve conversions and brand awareness.

&lt;h1&gt;Outbound to Inbound&lt;/h1&gt;
B2B sales is a high-stakes game. We know that even if the client doesn&amp;#39;t buy in over the phone, they will usually visit a website or investigate the company further. We offer the ability to schedule appointments online for future callbacks. This is also why we use unique URLs for B2B landing pages that offer specific value to the kinds of clients that we are reaching. Essentially, we use the introduction to gently push the lead down the stream of permission marketing.

&lt;h3&gt;In other words, telemarketing isn&amp;#39;t what it used to be. Kultured Kitsch uses the most sophisticated tools available to take the pressure off, allowing the newly informed business to come to us on their own terms.&lt;/h3&gt;

When a client is investigating their next purchase, who do they talk to? In this day and age, they immediately ask Google. Where does Google send these folk, yearning for information and authority to justify their purchases? Naturally, Google should send them to &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;! This is most rapidly accomplished through a blog.

&lt;h1&gt;Blogging for the client.&lt;/h1&gt;
All too often, this above process is viewed as a blogging for Google. This, like all lies, has a mote of truth: we much have Google read our blog to have Google refer our clients to it. Yet, the blog posts themselves must not only be human-readable, they must be client-relevant. This means, before anything else, answering the question that they originally searched for, clearly and completely.

&lt;h1&gt;Cutting-edge marketing tools.&lt;/h1&gt;
Once we begin connecting to clients, then it comes time to address the sales funnel. How can we connect to these clients after they read the post? How can we keep them on the site? How can we gauge their reactions?

&lt;p&gt;Modern Marketing tools enable us to track visitor behavior to a tee, to entrain them into a receptive mode, and to gather permission to contact for later marketing. Being able to adjust a blog with A/B testing, heatmaps, and overlays can mean all the difference in providing a successful user experience. Permission to email usually represents a critical gate between leads and sales, since most customer do not purchase during the research-stage.&lt;/p&gt;

";s:11:"description";s:2072:"&lt;h1&gt;Client Relationship Management keeps everyone happier.&lt;/h1&gt;
With the scale and speed of modern business, it has become impossible to keep customer relations in pace without help. In the same sense that accounting would be nothing without the calculator (or spreadsheet for that matter!), businesses have come to rely on software for managing their inventory of leads, clients, affiliates, suppliers, and partners. The more adept and sophisticated the CRM software, the better the company stands to make the most of preexisting partnerships.

&lt;h1&gt;CRM bloat is a relic.&lt;/h1&gt;
Many are familiar with the preexisting or historical CRM products and their inevitable bloat: too many spreadsheets, too much tracking, too much data entry. This is increasingly a thing of the past as modern CRM works closely alongside email to automatically gather information on new leads or old friends. In the same sense that all software is originally intended to optimize human efficiency, so too follows this sometimes complicated business software which occupies such an important niche.

&lt;h1&gt;Warm your leads; don&amp;#39;t burn them.&lt;/h1&gt;
Marketing should provide fantastic value to all parties. When you find that you&amp;#39;re interrupting or losing subscriptions, you may discover that you&amp;#39;re over-marketing (which isn&amp;#39;t very good marketing at all). CRM software can not only help monitor email marketing, it can keep close tabs on the marketing materials than an individual has already received and measure their response. Combined with an integrated website that provides user-initiated triggers for email, these mechanisms improve user retention dramatically.

Email marketing is a powerful way to remind your tribe exactly what&amp;#39;s on the collective mind on a regular basis. Naturally, being fairly obtrusive, it is also a double edged sword. To make the most out of your email list (or even to get one started), you need to focus on:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Asking permission to market further&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Providing genuine value (usually low-threshold and relevant) information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Delivering a thought-through value proposition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
This has to be done with the best marketing tools to make the most of your time. Your email client must support tracking open-rates, bounce rates, subscription actions, and CTA follow-throughs.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting out of the office is critical for finding new business. Let&amp;#39;s identify the three key components of a successful, in-person campaign:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Identifying and targeting venues frequented by your market&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Implementing a conscious marketing strategy during the event&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Providing materials, offers, or any form of value to these prospects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You don&amp;#39;t need to be a salesperson.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Though it helps.) Any representative of the business who is armed with a correctly assessed value proposition is capable of delivering. Simply by directing clients to other forms of marketing (Inbound, by definition), this marketing approach has worked its magic. While there are some industries with different expectations before sales, the general rule of thumb is that the big contracts don&amp;#39;t get signed at the convention; it is the well-placed phone call that seals the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Be the organizer!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine: all of your best clients under one roof, espousing your brand and selling to each other. This is increasingly the reality for highly-successful brands such as Nike or Apple. It doesn&amp;#39;t take a mult-million dollar IPO to have reason for a party, however: your best clients are spontaneously gathering with people of like interests all of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To the uninitiated, this sounds like corporate sponsorship of events.... That is a viable strategy for&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;businesses, though you will find our services for such listed under Advertising. In fact, I am referring to MeetUps, Facebook Events, and local festivals. It is of extremely low cost to get your tribe in one place if they sense the value of their meeting. Indeed, the company does not create this value: it is the aggregate exchange of like-minded people gathering for common purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By taking the initiative to organize, you leverage our most common human tendency for socialization and identify yourself as a member of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the key players in your field could be posting right now to a specialty online forum, determining market trands for the next decade. It is well known the forums allow for horizontal communications within online tribes, yet it is often undervalued as a marketing strategy. At Kultured Kitsch, we know that this avenue can sway the opinions of thousands of highly-qualified leads with simply a post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It&amp;#39;s all about reputation.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we maintain multiple accounts on myriad forums through the web, there is no guarantee that we have access to the community that is most relevant for your business. This means that a campaign to build authority on a forum can be slow-growing, yet often costing little more than labor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This represents a significant opportunity for the fully-fledged corporation and bootstrapped business alike. Since leads directed from a forum are typically well-educated consumers who are within your target market and exposed to your brand, it can be a very short journey to the sales page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Leverage thought-leaders.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another strategy is to influence specific thought leaders within the forum. This could be through a value proposition, yet it is more effective in the long-term to genuinely convince them of the value of your brand. Even better than cultivating reputation on the forum, when this strategy is applicable it is a home-run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;There are three stages to marketing on forums: identifying the most appropriate venues, building reputation, and providing unparalleled value. Kultured Kitsch is skilled in all three. Let&amp;#39;s begin your campaign today!&lt;/h3&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Client Relationship Management (CRM)&lt;/li&gt;

Let us unite your market and marry them to you.";s:11:"description";s:2336:"&lt;h1&gt;Your community is your greatest asset.&lt;/h1&gt;
The decreased cost and increased span of communications since the dawn of the digital age have shifted markets again and again, though the trajectory couldn&amp;#39;t be clearer. We all have a lot to say and we want a lot of people to hear it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An online community (an extant example being Facebook) is the tool that allows us to accomplish that. Taking the reigns of a community platform not only gives you greater control (which should be only sparsely exercised), it gives the ability to meet a communication market gap. In other words, your clients have an extended network of leads that may not be able to afford entry into your brand. By curating a social network, you provide the highest value (social connection) at no cost while simultaneously marketing to your hottest audience.
&lt;h1&gt;Your tribe looking for a leader.&lt;/h1&gt;
Your consumers are united by their interactions with you. The more platform that they have to express the nature of their relationship with you, your offerings, and their peers, the more robustly they will be able to advocate for you. Since word of mouth and customer reviews are the most influential forms of advertising, an online community provides these services to you spontaneously.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What draws them into the network is their desire to share and be of service to one another, which empowers your market to take new directions. Since social networking is increasingly simple to implement, you are either going to find yourself in a few short years either at the helm of the industry or working within another company&amp;#39;s social network.
&lt;h1&gt;Make it today, flourish tomorrow.&lt;/h1&gt;
Making an online community takes time. Not only in development, the gathering of community members is its own substantial marketing effort. Once the word spreads, however, there is a virtuous cycle of propagation. Subsequently, even if your industry isn&amp;#39;t going to give birth to a specific online community tomorrow it will pay to get started today. The average payback period for such an asset is 16 months.

Kultured Kitsch is well aware of the pulse of the market. We read the past; we see the future. Because of this acuteness, we are one of the first mainstream marketing companies to offer Reputation Monitoring for a price that a business not yet in the Fortune 500 can afford. The same quality service that is now prerequisite for the big businesses is available to you through our services.

&lt;h1&gt;Reputation is the new currency of business.&lt;/h1&gt;
As dollars become more scarce for the average individual, trust in the businesses that they engage with becomes more precious as well. It is essential that the consumer receives &lt;i&gt;value&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;for their transaction. How do consumers determine value? Of course there are many psychological factors at work, yet the strongest driver is the social instinct. As the Internet aggregates and averages user ratings, this tendency is going to become increasingly accurate and thus reinforced.

&lt;h1&gt;Is quality enough?&lt;/h1&gt;
Yes, if your delivery is consistently excellent, then your reputation online should ensue. Yet, reputation monitoring isn&amp;#39;t simply for recovery or preventing sabotage. It is about &lt;strong&gt;capitalizing on reputation to the fullest.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;This means going beyond excellent service by offering social incentives that encourage the ecstatic consumer to share their feelings with their social network (both digital and analog).

&lt;h1&gt;Social signals are the most powerful marketing agents.&lt;/h1&gt;
When well-connected members of a group publicly adopt a new habit, their whole social group follows. This is not simply a domino effect or follow-the-leader: it takes repeated, powerful social cues that are reinforced over time. Thus, online reputation and reviews are one such strategy to achieving this end. Still, there are other exciting mechanisms which are so cutting-edge that we only share them with our closest affiliated brands.

&lt;p&gt;Like nothing else, video can really distill your brand personality into just moments. As humans, we derive the better portion of our trust from social signals which lie buried in intuition. In only milliseconds, an individual makes a thousands of analyses regarding the veracity of the presenter with information such as appearance, posture, tone, and facial expression. This is ultimately to your advantage as it allows you to stand out in a sea of otherwise faceless brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Showcase your clients: show your value.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been demonstrated time and time again that the strongest marketing is word of mouth. The more direct, familiar, and personal manner in which the referral is made, the better the effect. Video gives you not only the advantage of tapping into this human element, the decreasing costs of film production are allowing your consumers to broadcast via this medium. For example, imagine the value of incentivizing video product reviews. This is only one of the myriad strategies that Kultured Kitsch regularly uses to promote our inner circle of clients.&lt;/p&gt;

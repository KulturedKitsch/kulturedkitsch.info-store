When a client is investigating their next purchase, who do they talk to? In this day and age, they immediately ask Google. Where does Google send these folk, yearning for information and authority to justify their purchases? Naturally, Google should send them to &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;! This is most rapidly accomplished through a blog.

&lt;h1&gt;Blogging for the client.&lt;/h1&gt;
All too often, this above process is viewed as a blogging for Google. This, like all lies, has a mote of truth: we much have Google read our blog to have Google refer our clients to it. Yet, the blog posts themselves must not only be human-readable, they must be client-relevant. This means, before anything else, answering the question that they originally searched for, clearly and completely.

&lt;h1&gt;Cutting-edge marketing tools.&lt;/h1&gt;
Once we begin connecting to clients, then it comes time to address the sales funnel. How can we connect to these clients after they read the post? How can we keep them on the site? How can we gauge their reactions?

&lt;p&gt;Modern Marketing tools enable us to track visitor behavior to a tee, to entrain them into a receptive mode, and to gather permission to contact for later marketing. Being able to adjust a blog with A/B testing, heatmaps, and overlays can mean all the difference in providing a successful user experience. Permission to email usually represents a critical gate between leads and sales, since most customer do not purchase during the research-stage.&lt;/p&gt;

";s:11:"description";s:2072:"&lt;h1&gt;Client Relationship Management keeps everyone happier.&lt;/h1&gt;
With the scale and speed of modern business, it has become impossible to keep customer relations in pace without help. In the same sense that accounting would be nothing without the calculator (or spreadsheet for that matter!), businesses have come to rely on software for managing their inventory of leads, clients, affiliates, suppliers, and partners. The more adept and sophisticated the CRM software, the better the company stands to make the most of preexisting partnerships.

&lt;h1&gt;CRM bloat is a relic.&lt;/h1&gt;
Many are familiar with the preexisting or historical CRM products and their inevitable bloat: too many spreadsheets, too much tracking, too much data entry. This is increasingly a thing of the past as modern CRM works closely alongside email to automatically gather information on new leads or old friends. In the same sense that all software is originally intended to optimize human efficiency, so too follows this sometimes complicated business software which occupies such an important niche.

&lt;h1&gt;Warm your leads; don&amp;#39;t burn them.&lt;/h1&gt;
Marketing should provide fantastic value to all parties. When you find that you&amp;#39;re interrupting or losing subscriptions, you may discover that you&amp;#39;re over-marketing (which isn&amp;#39;t very good marketing at all). CRM software can not only help monitor email marketing, it can keep close tabs on the marketing materials than an individual has already received and measure their response. Combined with an integrated website that provides user-initiated triggers for email, these mechanisms improve user retention dramatically.

&lt;br /&gt;
Email marketing is a powerful way to remind your tribe exactly what&amp;#39;s on the collective mind on a regular basis. Naturally, being fairly obtrusive, it is also a double edged sword. To make the most out of your email list (or even to get one started), you need to focus on:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Asking permission to market further&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Providing genuine value (usually low-threshold and relevant) information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Delivering a thought-through value proposition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
This has to be done with the best marketing tools to make the most of your time. Your email client must support tracking open-rates, bounce rates, subscription actions, and CTA follow-throughs.&lt;br /&gt;

Let us unite your market and marry them to you.";s:11:"description";s:2336:"&lt;h1&gt;Your community is your greatest asset.&lt;/h1&gt;
The decreased cost and increased span of communications since the dawn of the digital age have shifted markets again and again, though the trajectory couldn&amp;#39;t be clearer. We all have a lot to say and we want a lot of people to hear it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An online community (an extant example being Facebook) is the tool that allows us to accomplish that. Taking the reigns of a community platform not only gives you greater control (which should be only sparsely exercised), it gives the ability to meet a communication market gap. In other words, your clients have an extended network of leads that may not be able to afford entry into your brand. By curating a social network, you provide the highest value (social connection) at no cost while simultaneously marketing to your hottest audience.
&lt;h1&gt;Your tribe looking for a leader.&lt;/h1&gt;
Your consumers are united by their interactions with you. The more platform that they have to express the nature of their relationship with you, your offerings, and their peers, the more robustly they will be able to advocate for you. Since word of mouth and customer reviews are the most influential forms of advertising, an online community provides these services to you spontaneously.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What draws them into the network is their desire to share and be of service to one another, which empowers your market to take new directions. Since social networking is increasingly simple to implement, you are either going to find yourself in a few short years either at the helm of the industry or working within another company&amp;#39;s social network.
&lt;h1&gt;Make it today, flourish tomorrow.&lt;/h1&gt;
Making an online community takes time. Not only in development, the gathering of community members is its own substantial marketing effort. Once the word spreads, however, there is a virtuous cycle of propagation. Subsequently, even if your industry isn&amp;#39;t going to give birth to a specific online community tomorrow it will pay to get started today. The average payback period for such an asset is 16 months.

Kultured Kitsch is well aware of the pulse of the market. We read the past; we see the future. Because of this acuteness, we are one of the first mainstream marketing companies to offer Reputation Monitoring for a price that a business not yet in the Fortune 500 can afford. The same quality service that is now prerequisite for the big businesses is available to you through our services.

&lt;h1&gt;Reputation is the new currency of business.&lt;/h1&gt;
As dollars become more scarce for the average individual, trust in the businesses that they engage with becomes more precious as well. It is essential that the consumer receives &lt;i&gt;value&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;for their transaction. How do consumers determine value? Of course there are many psychological factors at work, yet the strongest driver is the social instinct. As the Internet aggregates and averages user ratings, this tendency is going to become increasingly accurate and thus reinforced.

&lt;h1&gt;Is quality enough?&lt;/h1&gt;
Yes, if your delivery is consistently excellent, then your reputation online should ensue. Yet, reputation monitoring isn&amp;#39;t simply for recovery or preventing sabotage. It is about &lt;strong&gt;capitalizing on reputation to the fullest.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;This means going beyond excellent service by offering social incentives that encourage the ecstatic consumer to share their feelings with their social network (both digital and analog).

&lt;h1&gt;Social signals are the most powerful marketing agents.&lt;/h1&gt;
When well-connected members of a group publicly adopt a new habit, their whole social group follows. This is not simply a domino effect or follow-the-leader: it takes repeated, powerful social cues that are reinforced over time. Thus, online reputation and reviews are one such strategy to achieving this end. Still, there are other exciting mechanisms which are so cutting-edge that we only share them with our closest affiliated brands.
